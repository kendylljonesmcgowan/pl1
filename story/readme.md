# Story using Google Dynamic Maps

Welcome to the Good-Strolls Map! 

This Google Dynamic Map highlights my top 4 walks in Canada, and the trail I walk every day.

Walking is a very important part of my life, especially since COVID started. 

So, I thought I would make a map dedicated to my top 4 favourite walks in Canada (so far...). 

I hope you enjoy, and I hope you get to go on some of these walks one day too!
